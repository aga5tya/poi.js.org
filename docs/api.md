## JavaScript API

```js
const poi = require('poi')

const app = poi({
  entry: './src/my-entry.js'
})
```

<p class="tip">
  Note that when you're using the API interface, Poi would not load external config files like `poi.config.js` `.babelrc` etc.
</p>

## API

### poi(options)

#### options

It is the same as the config in config file, with following addtional options:

##### mode

Default: `undefined`<br>
Value: `oneOf(['development', 'production', 'watch', 'test'])`

### app.prepare()

Return: `Promise`

Poi would load presets, babel/postcss config files here.

### app.getWebpackConfig()

Build app in production mode

### app.watch()

Return: `Promise`

Build app and watch files changes.
